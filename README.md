Weather App - COMP3123 Lab Test 2
This is my weather application for the COMP3123 Lab Test 2. The app is a simple yet functional weather application built using ReactJS. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays details like temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed for a given city. The app is dynamic and allows users to search for weather information for any city worldwide.
